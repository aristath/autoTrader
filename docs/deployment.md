# Deployment and recovery

The production target is `aristath@clara.local`. Sentinel runs inside the
target's `clara` toolbox container and is managed by a user systemd service on
the host.

## Production contract

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Branch | `main` |
| Repository | `/var/home/aristath/sentinel` |
| Container | `clara` |
| Service | `sentinel.service` |
| Bind address | `0.0.0.0` |
| HTTP port | `8000` |
| Health endpoint | `http://clara.local:8000/api/health` |
| Forecast service | `sentinel-forecasting.service`, container-local port `8010` |

Port 8000 is the production application port. High-numbered ports used for
parallel local development are not production configuration.

## What the service does

`systemd/sentinel.service` performs these steps on every start:

1. fetch `origin/main` inside the toolbox;
2. hard-reset the production checkout to `origin/main`;
3. run `uv sync --locked`;
4. execute `.venv/bin/python main.py --host 0.0.0.0`; and
5. restart after a failure.

Consequences:

- Uncommitted production-checkout changes are discarded on service start.
- A release must be committed and pushed to `main`.
- The lock file must represent every required production dependency.
- `web/dist` must be built and committed before the service is restarted.

`sentinel-deploy.timer` checks `origin/main` every minute. If the checked-out
revision differs, it restarts `sentinel.service`, whose pre-start step advances
the checkout.

## Release procedure

Before pushing:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
pyright
pytest
cd web
npm ci
npm run build
```

Review the diff and commit the source, lock file changes, documentation, and
tracked production bundle together. Push the intended commit to `main`.

To deploy immediately from the repository root:

```bash
scripts/deploy.sh
```

The script restarts the remote user service and waits up to 180 seconds for the
health endpoint. Set `SENTINEL_TARGET` only when deploying to a different SSH
target:

```bash
SENTINEL_TARGET=user@host scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Verification

A successful local build or a green systemd status is not proof that production
serves the intended release. Verify all relevant boundaries:

```bash
ssh aristath@clara.local 'systemctl --user --no-pager --full status sentinel.service'
ssh aristath@clara.local "podman exec --user aristath clara bash -lc 'cd /var/home/aristath/sentinel && git rev-parse HEAD'"
curl --fail --silent http://clara.local:8000/api/health
curl --fail --silent http://clara.local:8000/ | head
```

For a frontend change, confirm that the HTML references the bundle created by
the released revision and exercise the affected interaction in a browser. For a
database, scheduler, broker, AI, or forecasting change, verify the corresponding
real endpoint or job status rather than relying on `/api/health` alone.

Useful logs:

```bash
ssh aristath@clara.local 'journalctl --user -u sentinel.service -n 200 --no-pager'
ssh aristath@clara.local 'journalctl --user -u sentinel-forecasting.service -n 200 --no-pager'
```

## Rollback

Production follows `origin/main`; restarting after manually checking out an old
revision will immediately reset it again. The durable rollback is therefore:

1. revert the bad commit on `main`;
2. rebuild and commit `web/dist` if the reverted change affected the frontend;
3. push the revert; and
4. run `scripts/deploy.sh` and repeat live verification.

Do not use a manual hard reset in a working development checkout as a rollback
procedure.

## SQLite backup and restore

The default data directory is `data/`, unless `SENTINEL_DATA_DIR` changes it.
Before a risky migration, use the configured R2 backup job or make a filesystem
copy while Sentinel is stopped. SQLite sidecar files are part of the live state:
copy the database, `-wal`, and `-shm` files together when they exist.

For a manual production restore:

1. stop `sentinel.service`;
2. preserve the current database files as a recoverable copy;
3. replace the database and matching sidecars with the selected backup;
4. confirm ownership and permissions;
5. start the service; and
6. verify health plus representative portfolio/settings endpoints.

Never overwrite a database while the application is writing to it. See
[Database](database.md) for ownership and migration rules.

## Forecasting service

Forecasting is a separate optional service. `sentinel-forecasting.service` runs
the Toto provider from `.venv-forecasting` on container-local port 8010. Its
failure must not prevent the main Sentinel API from serving; forecast status and
planner inputs should instead show that no fresh forecast is available.
