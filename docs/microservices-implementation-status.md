## Migration Strategy

### Current State
- All services run in-process (mode: "local" in `app/config/services.yaml`)
- No network communication between services
- Existing monolithic architecture still functional

### Transition Path
1. ✅ Create service interfaces (DONE)
2. 🔄 Create gRPC clients and servers (IN PROGRESS)
3. ⏳ Test locally with gRPC on localhost
4. ⏳ Switch services to gRPC mode one-by-one
5. ⏳ Deploy to dual-device setup
6. ⏳ Production hardening

### Rollback Plan
- Service locator supports both "local" and "remote" modes
- Can switch back to local mode in configuration
- No changes to existing domain logic required

---

## Configuration Examples

### Single Device (Current)
```yaml
# app/config/device.yaml
device:
  id: "primary"
  roles: ["all"]  # Run all services

# app/config/services.yaml
services:
  planning:
    mode: "local"  # In-process
    device_id: "primary"
```

### Dual Device (Future)
```yaml
# Device 1: Compute services
device:
  id: "compute-1"
  roles: ["planning", "scoring", "optimization"]

# Device 2: State services
device:
  id: "state-1"
  roles: ["portfolio", "trading", "universe", "gateway"]

# Services configuration
services:
  planning:
    mode: "remote"  # Via gRPC
    device_id: "compute-1"
  portfolio:
    mode: "remote"
    device_id: "state-1"
```

## Summary

**Completed**: Phases 1, 2a, 2b - Full service interface layer
**In Progress**: Phase 3 - gRPC clients
**Remaining**: Phases 4-7 - Servers, testing, deployment, hardening

The foundation is solid. The service interface pattern is established. Next steps are to complete gRPC clients, create servers, and begin testing.
